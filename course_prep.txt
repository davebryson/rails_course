Preparing for the course

1. Download and Install Ruby 1.8.6:

 - Windows: http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167
 - OS X 10.5 you should already have it installed if you installed the OS X developer tools
 - Linux apt-get, yum, rpm, or build from source

Once installed, you should be able to open a terminal and run:
> ruby -v
to verify it's installed correctly

2. Install Mysql or you can also use Sqlite3 if you are comfortable with it

3. Install Rails
From a terminal run:
 - gem install rails -y 
OR from behind the MITRE proxy run
 - gem install rails -p http://gatekeeper.mitre.org:80  -y

You can verify it's installed correctly by running the following command from a terminal:
> rails -v
You should see Rails 2.1.0

4. If using Mysql install the mysql gem:
> gem install -p mysql
